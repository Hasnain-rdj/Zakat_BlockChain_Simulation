### Data Structures

#### Block Structure
```python
{
    'index': int,                    # Block number in chain
    'timestamp': str,                # Block creation time
    'transactions': [{}],            # List of transactions
    'previous_hash': str,            # Hash of previous block
    'roll_number_seed': str,         # Student's roll number (seed key)
    'nonce': int,                    # Proof of work (set to 0)
    'hash': str                      # Current block hash
}
```

#### Transaction Structure
```python

    'type': str,                     # Transaction type
    'amount': float,                 # Transaction amount
    'balance_before': float,         # Balance before transaction
    'balance_after': float,          # Balance after transaction
    'description': str,              # Transaction description

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Basic Zakat Testing
1. Initialize blockchain with your roll number
2. Verify starting balance (200 coins)
3. Perform Zakat deduction (5 coins = 2.5% of 200)
4. Check remaining balance (195 coins)
5. Validate blockchain integrity

### Advanced Testing
1. Add custom income transactions
2. Perform multiple Zakat deductions
3. Verify hash uniqueness with different roll numbers
4. Test blockchain validation after simulated tampering

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

- ✅ Zakat calculates exactly 2.5% of current balance
- ✅ Each block has unique hash based on roll number seed
- ✅ Previous hash correctly links to prior block
- ✅ Transaction history maintains complete records
- ✅ Blockchain validation detects tampering
- ✅ Interface displays all required information
- ✅ Code uses only lists and dictionaries (no external blockchain libraries)

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Roll Number: CS2021001
Starting Balance: 200.0 coins
First Zakat: 5.0 coins (2.5% of 200)
Remaining Balance: 195.0 coins
Blocks Created: 2 (Genesis + Zakat Transaction)
Blockchain Status: ✅ Valid
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Please enter a roll number" error**
   - Ensure you've entered your roll number in the sidebar
   - Click "Initialize Blockchain" after entering roll number

2. **"Insufficient balance" error**
   - Balance must be > 0 for Zakat deduction
   - Add income transactions if needed for testing

3. **Blockchain validation fails**
   - Check if any manual modifications were made to chain data
   - Re-initialize blockchain if corruption detected

4. **Streamlit not found**
   - Run: `pip install streamlit`
   - Ensure Python and pip are properly installed
